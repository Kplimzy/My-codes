    <h1><strong><u>MY BIOGRAPHY</u></strong></h1>
    <p>My name is Zikimeh Elikpim Kweku Enuameh.</p>
     <p>I am eighteen years old. I come from Vane Avatime
       which is in the Volta region but I stay in Kumasi. I am a former student at Our Lady of Grace 
       Senior High School. I am now in my first year of the prestigious Kwame Nkrumah University of 
       Science and Technology.
    </p>
    <p>I am now achieving my course of study which is Computer Engineering.</p>
    <p>I have always been interested in computers from a young age. I am a good typist and I am getting 
        better in terms of the software and hardware related aspects so I am qualified for this course.
